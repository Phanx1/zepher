Memory protection in zephyr.

Zephyr gears towards microcontrollers with MPU(memory protection unit) hardware. Do support architecture with paged MMU(memory management unit)but 
it is  treated similar to an MPU with and identity page table. 

CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION is a feature which detects stack buffer overflows when the system si running in supercisor mde. this catches when the entire 
stack buffer has overflowed

k_xxxx_alloc_init() sets up k_xxxx with a its storage buffer allocated out of a resouce pool instead of a buffer provided by the user. k_free() frees the memory

The kernel ensure any user thread only has acess to its own stack buffe, program text, and read-only data. You want to minimize the number of boot-time
MPU regions becuase that effets your ability to grant additiona blocs of memory to a user thread.

Memory partitions consit of a memory address, size and access attributes.
